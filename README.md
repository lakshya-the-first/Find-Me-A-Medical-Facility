# Find-Me-A-Medical-Facility
This was a hackathon project that my team and I created at DeltaHacks in Jan 2020. This project was meant to help individuals in densely populated areas to find a medical facility with minimal wait periods based on information from various hospitals and medical centres in the area. 

Technology used:

  This project was coded in C++ to illustrate the back-end and HTML/CSS for the front-end. My responsibility for this project was the back-end due to my proficiency in C++. 

How it worked:

  A text file represented the input from the medical facilities. This included information such as their address, the services they provide, and the wait time for each of these services. Based on the services that the user required (and inputted), the system would calculate where they would received the quickest care. This system took into consideration the services required, their wait times, and the average travel time to the hospital based on the initial location of the user.
